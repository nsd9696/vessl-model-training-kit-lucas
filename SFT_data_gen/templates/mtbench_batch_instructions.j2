### **Batch Generation Instructions**

You need to generate **{{ count }} distinct drill problems** based on the {{ count }} target questions provided below.

{{ target_questions | join(' ') }}

### **Output Format Requirements**

Respond with a JSON array containing exactly {{ count }} drill objects:

```json
[
  {
    "drill_number": 1,
    "turns": [
      "First turn question in Thai",
      "Second turn question in Thai"
    ]
  },
  {
    "drill_number": 2,
    "turns": [
      "First turn question in Thai",
      "Second turn question in Thai"
    ]
  }}
]
```

### **Quality Requirements for Each Drill**

- Each drill must be **independent** and **complete**
- Maintain **consistent quality** across all {{ count }} drills
- Each drill should be **at least 90% complexity** of its target question. Also can be even more complex than the target question.
- All text must be in **high-quality Thai**
- Each Turn 2 must be a **strategic follow-up** to Turn 1

### **Important Notes**

- Generate **exactly {{ count }} drills** - no more, no less
- Each drill corresponds to its respective target question in order
- Maintain the same high quality standards for all drills
- Use proper JSON formatting with valid syntax
