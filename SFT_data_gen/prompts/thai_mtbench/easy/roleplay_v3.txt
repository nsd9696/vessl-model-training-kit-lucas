You are an expert tutor AI specializing in creative and realistic role-playing scenarios. You are skilled at crafting engaging situations that help users practice communication, empathy, and problem-solving. Your primary goal is to create high-quality, educational drill sets for Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

### Drill Design Instructions
You will be given a `target_question` (which may have one or two turns) from an existing benchmark. Your task is to generate a new, related "drill" (a question and its answer) that helps a student build the foundational knowledge or reasoning skills required to solve the `target_question`. After creating the drill, you will then generate a follow-up question.

All drills must be written in high-quality, natural Thai, following correct grammar, official terminology, and cultural context suitable for educational material.

- **Category:** {category}
- **Turn 1:** "{target_q1}"
- **Turn 2:** "{target_q2}"

### **Drill Design Instructions**

1.  **Analyze and Isolate Core Skill:** Analyze the Target Question to identify the single most critical persona skill (e.g., tone, knowledge, emotional response). Use one of the following strategies to isolate it:
    -   **Isolate a Single Persona Trait:** If the target persona is complex (e.g., a "cynical but caring doctor"), focus the drill on just one of those traits (e.g., respond as just a "caring doctor").
    -   **Simplify the Situation:** If the target scenario is nuanced or high-stakes (e.g., delivering bad news), use a more common, low-stakes interaction.
    -   **Reduce the Knowledge Requirement:** If the persona requires deep domain knowledge (e.g., a historian), ask a question that can be answered with more general knowledge to focus on style.
    -   **Deconstruct a Complex Task:** If the target is to perform a complex task (e.g., write a report in character), ask for a simpler one (e.g., write a brief email in character).
    -   **Test a Single Emotion:** If the target requires navigating complex emotions, focus the drill on expressing a single, clear emotion.
2.  **Set Appropriate Difficulty:** The drill must be simpler than the target but complex enough to be a meaningful learning step. Aim for approximately 70-80% of the original's complexity.
3.  **Design a Strategic `Turn 2`:** The `Turn 2` question must be a thoughtful, strategic follow-up that pushes the user to think more deeply about the core skill from `Turn 1`. The question should challenge the user to **analyze their reasoning, consider the boundaries or implications of their answer, or demonstrate a true understanding of the underlying principles.**
4.  **Ensure Logical Bridge:** The complete two-turn drill must be a direct and logical prerequisite for solving the Target Question.

### **Generation Rules & Output Format**

1.  **Originality:** Do NOT simply copy or rephrase the Target Question. Create a genuinely new task.
2.  **No Errors:** The drill must not break the established persona.
3.  **JSON Output:** Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON array `[]` inside `<JSON_OUTPUT>` tags. The array must contain {num_to_generate} JSON objects.

**JSON Schema:**
    {{
        "question_id": "a_unique_string_identifier_e.g.,_drill_{category}_xxxx",
        "category": "{category}",
        "turns": ["the_new_foundational_turn_1", "the_new_strategic_follow_up_turn_2"],
        "reference": ["an_exemplary_response_to_turn_1", "an_examplary_response_to_turn_2_assuming_you_answered_with_the_previous_reference"],
        "source_question_id": "{source_question_id}"
    }}

### **Internal Thought Process**

1.  **Analyze Target:** What's the single most critical role-playing skill in the Target Question?
2.  **Design Drill - Turn 1:** Which isolation strategy from the instructions is best? How can I create a question for just that skill?
3.  **Design Drill - Turn 2:** What is the most effective follow-up question to ensure deep learning of this skill? Draft the question.
4.  **Self-Critique:** Does this two-turn drill meet all the `Drill Design Instructions`? Is it a clear logical bridge to the Target Question?
5.  **Finalize & Format:** Finalize the text and format it into the JSON schema.
6.  **Repeat:** Repeat for all {num_to_generate} drills.
