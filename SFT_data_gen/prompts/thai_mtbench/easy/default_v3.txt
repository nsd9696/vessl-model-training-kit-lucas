You are an expert AI curriculum designer. Your task is to generate high-quality, two-turn instructional drills based on a given 'Target Question'.

**Your Goal:** Generate {num_to_generate} unique 'Foundational Drills'. Each drill must be a targeted, two-turn exercise designed to train a specific skill required to solve the Target Question.

All drills must be written in high-quality, natural Thai, following correct grammar, official terminology, and cultural context suitable for educational material.

- **Category:** {category}
- **Turn 1:** "{target_q1}"
- **Turn 2:** "{target_q2}"

### **Drill Design Instructions**

1.  **Analyze and Isolate Core Skill:** Analyze the Target Question to identify the single most critical skill required to solve it (e.g., a specific formula, a key reasoning step, a programming concept). Create a new `Turn 1` that isolates and trains ONLY that single core skill.
2.  **Set Appropriate Difficulty:** The drill must be simpler than the target but complex enough to be a meaningful learning step. Aim for approximately 70-80% of the original's complexity.
3.  **Design a Strategic `Turn 2`:** The `Turn 2` question must be a thoughtful, strategic follow-up that pushes the user to think more deeply about the core skill from `Turn 1`. The question should challenge the user to **analyze their reasoning, consider the boundaries or implications of their answer, or demonstrate a true understanding of the underlying principles.**
4.  **Ensure Logical Bridge:** The complete two-turn drill must be a direct and logical prerequisite for solving the Target Question.

### **Generation Rules & Output Format**

1.  **Originality:** Do NOT simply copy or rephrase the Target Question. Create a genuinely new task.
2.  **No Errors:** The drill must NOT contain factually incorrect, ambiguous, or nonsensical information.
3.  **JSON Output:** Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON array `[]` inside `<JSON_OUTPUT>` tags. The array must contain {num_to_generate} JSON objects.

**JSON Schema:**
```json
{
    "question_id": "drill_{category}_xxxx",
    "category": "{category}",
    "turns": [
        "First foundational question in Thai that isolates the core skill",
        "Strategic follow-up question in Thai that deepens understanding"
    ],
    "reference":
    [
        "Comprehensive answer to the first turn in Thai",
        "Comprehensive answer to the second turn in Thai"
    ],
    "source_question_id": "{source_question_id}"
}
```

### **Internal Thought Process**

1.  **Analyze Target:** What's the single most critical skill in the Target Question?
2.  **Design Drill - Turn 1:** How can I create a question that isolates just that skill?
3.  **Design Drill - Turn 2:** What is the most effective follow-up question to ensure deep learning of this skill? Draft the question.
5.  **Self-Critique:** Does this two-turn drill meet all the `Drill Design Instructions`? Is it a clear logical bridge to the Target Question?
6.  **Finalize & Format:** Finalize the text and format it into the JSON schema.
