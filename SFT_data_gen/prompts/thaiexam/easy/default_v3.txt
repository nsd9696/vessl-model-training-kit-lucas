You are an expert AI curriculum designer. Your task is to generate a high-quality multiple choice question based on a given 'Target Question'.

**Your Goal:** Generate {num_to_generate} unique 'Foundational Drills'. Each drill must be a targeted, multiple choice problem designed to train a specific skill required to solve the Target Question.

---

- **Category:** {category}
- **Question:** {question}
= **Choices:**  {choices}

---

### **Drill Design Instructions**

1.  **Analyze and Isolate Core Skill:** Analyze the Target Question to identify the skills and knowledge needed to solve the question. Isolate a single skill (e.g., linguistic expertise, a key reasoning step, or a specialized knowledge) and create a new question that would require those skills.
2.  **Difficulty of the Question:** The drill must be simpler than the target but complex enough to be a meaningful learning step. Aim for approximately 70-80% of the original's complexity.
3.  **Make five choices for the answer** The target question might offer either four or five choices. Regardless of the number of choices, generate five choices labelled a, b, c, d, and e with one of them being the right answer for the drill question. Try to make the other four wrong choices not so blatantly wrong for the right difficulty.
4.  **Answer the question:** With a reasoning for why each choice is right/wrong, state the right answer. The label for the right answer (a, b, c, d, e) must be explicitly stated.

### **Thai Language Quality Guidelines**

All drills must be written in high-quality, natural Thai, following correct grammar, official terminology, and cultural context suitable for educational material.

### **Generation Rules & Output Format**

1.  **Originality:** Do NOT simply copy or rephrase the Target Question. Create a genuinely new task.
2.  **No Errors:** The drill must NOT contain factually incorrect, ambiguous, or nonsensical information.
3.  **JSON Output:** Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON array `[]` inside `<JSON_OUTPUT>` tags. The array must contain {num_to_generate} JSON objects.

**JSON Schema:**
```json
{
    "category": "{category}",
    "question": "A question in Thai that isolates the core skill",
    "choices": { 
        "a" : "The first choice for the answer",
        "b" : "The second choice for the answer",
        "c" : "The third choice for the answer",
        "d" : "The fourth choice for the answer",
        "e" : "The fifth choice for the answer"
    }
    "answer": {
        "explanation": "Answer to the question in Thai with the label of the answer explicitly stated"
        "label": "The label of the answer, one of a, b, c, d, e"
        },
}
```

### **Internal Thought Process**

1.  **Analyze Target:** What's the most critical skills for the Target Question?
2.  **Design Drill - Turn 1:** How can I create a question that utilizes that skill?
3.  **Self-Critique:** Does this drill meet all the `Drill Design Instructions`? Is it a clear logical bridge to the Target Question?
4.  **Finalize & Format:** Finalize the text and format it into the JSON schema.
